## About

The data behind the charts is stored in this repository and a copy of it is
[publicly visible on google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z-C7F6pdytXxgrJLa5wsVz4EqMQL3eTNVx1OuVH_0oc/edit?usp=sharing).
I compiled both the data and the charts over the space of a few weeks and
as such there may be mistakes that could be corrected or additional entities
and investments that could be added. I don't assure that any of the figures
on these charts are 100% accurate. They are estimates only, based on reports
in the news media, statements made on social media and financial statements.
Assertions of confidence in the figures is subjective and you should view these
charts with a critical eye.

I welcome auditing of the data and improvements to the code and both may be
made in the form of adding issues or submitting pull requests to the repository.

I created this page because I wanted to visualise the growth in institutional
investments into bitcoin. Anyone who has kept an eye on cryptocurrency news
since 2020 would be aware of the increasing number of companies and
influential people adding bitcoin and crypto assets to their balance sheets.

The repository [nvk/bitcointreasuries.org](https://github.com/nvk/bitcointreasuries.org) and [accompanying website](https://bitcointreasuries.org)
are a good snapshot of the current state of institutional investment in bitcoin.
This page is designed to add an understanding of how this aspect of bitcoin has
changed over time.

The bitcoin prices file was downloaded from coindesk at <https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin>.
